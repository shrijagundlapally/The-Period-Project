    <h1 class="takeActionTitle">Why is the Pink Tax a problem?
 
    <h2 class="takeActionText1">➡ The pink tax leads to further inequality and gender gap between men and women. Women having to pay more for certain goods marketed to women while earning less  than men leads to men holding a significant amount of purchasing power in the economy</h2>

    <h2>➡ Women pay more than men for certain goods, like clothes and home health products and personal care products. In fact, according to NPR, a study found that women pay as much as 13 percent more for some categories of products!</h2>

    <h2>➡ According to Good Housekeeping, “almost all states exempt non-luxury necessities like groceries and prescriptions, but all but 10 charge tax on tampons and feminine pads — despite their necessity for most women.”</h2>

    <h2>➡ This gender-based pricing discrepancy is also known as the “tampon tax,” referring to a fee that women are charged for feminine hygiene products</h2>

    <h2>➡ It’s not just the difference of a few cents hitting a family’s bottom line. The pink tax is part of a larger problem of gender bias that affects women’s wages, as well as women’s sports teams being paid less than men’s teams</h2>

    <h1>What can we do to stop this?</h1>
